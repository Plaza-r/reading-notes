The employee backlash over googles censored serach engine for China, explained
This artice relates to ethics in technology because it discusses the desicions Google is making in certain countries and how their technology is being implemented. 
Their is a concern that google is abiding by China's censorhip laws and more sepeficially had a project dragonfly which would censor human rights websites from being
shown to the chinese population. The aritcle also disscued how the United States is using some technology to identify human faces for drone targets. I agree with the 
article when it comes to probably being concern with what is happening with google in China. China has been known to violate theirs citizens human rights when it concerns
privacy, right, or what ever topic they find taboo. THis is something to keep an eye on especially when google influence on the world is growing and Chinas influence on 
google gets stronger.

BIG DATA IS OUR GENERATION’S CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE, AND WE DON’T KNOW IT
This article goes into detail on how data collection can be used for alterior motives. One example given when a american express customer had his credit limit 
decreased beasue the stroes he shopped in had other customers who had history of poor repayment.  I agree with the article that the collection of our data and its use
to "personalized" the results as concerning. How these companies choose to manipulate these results don't have much in the form of regulation.  I think as far as civl 
right issues I am more concerned with my privacy rather then a bank being able to tell them I am a latino. I have also read of companies that test your ancestry
use that data and sell it to insurance companies so they can see your health concerns.

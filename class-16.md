# What is serverless?

Serverless is a cloud computing app that enables developers to to build and run apps cod with out managing servers or backend infrastructure.
This is a plus because allows developers to focus on the front end code and the business.
To use serverless all you have to do is write the code and deploy into containers managed by cloud server provider.
cloud provider handes "rest" and the scaling
cloud provider resplisble for all routine infrastructure management.
*****never pay for ide capacity. cloud provider provisions computer resources.
billing starts when execution starts and stops when it ends
pricing depends on excution time
*** serverless does not mean 'no servers', though they are invisble to the developer because they dont deal with it
leading cloud server providers are AWS, microsft azure, google cloud, ibm cloud
serverless is more than jsut FaaS(function as a service)
FaaS is cloud computing server that enables developers to run code in response to specific eventrs or request
FaaS also compute model central tro serveless and terms are interchangable
Serveless is an entire stack of  services that can respond to sepcific events
databases SQL and NoSQL and object storeage are the foundation of teh data layer
serverless  architecturea are well suited for event driven and stream processing workloads
api gateways act as proxies to web actions 
 

# Pros:

improved developer productivity, less work to do in the backend
pay for execution, means less money
possible to develop in any language - serverless is polygot any langauge
its cost effective when it comes to performance
usage visiblity - servelrss platforms provies near total visibilty in a system

#Cons:
unacceptable latency for certin apps
higher cost for stable  workloads - not cost effective when it comes to predictble processes/bad
monoitor and debugging issues- teams may find it impossible to minotr or debug serverless functinos using existing tools
vendor lock in-  its hard to go from on cloud provider to the other 
 

# What do I want to learn more about?

this seems like it would make my life a little bit easier so, it is a good tool to add to my tool box. So probably go in more depth in this subject.

Ch. 15 layout
Ths chapter teaches about page layout and design
Css treats each html element as a box
Box either block-level or inline box
If block level is inside another box-level, outer one is known as parent
Normal flow: every box level element appears on new lines
Relative positioning moves element from on position to to top right left, bottom 
Clear property allows to say that no element should touch left or right side of box
Some web pages use multiple columns in design, is possible with <div> element
Web pages need to be able to work with different screen sizes, because not all viewers will have same screen, even including smart phones
Screen resolution refers to the number of dots a screen show per inch
960-1000 pixels wide is what generally is used to crate pages
Liquid layout design stretch and contract as teh user increase or decrease browser

Article 6
Pair programing is practice with 2 developers sharing single workstation, and tackle the problems and provide solutions together
2 heads better then one
It involves 2 roles the driver and teh navigator
Driver is tying and has hands on keyboard like a driver with a steering wheel
They manage text editor, switching some files, and writing code
Navigator uses words to help guide the driver but does not input directly on computer
Must have big picture in mind, what will come next and looking for bugs
4 skills used to learn a new language include:
Listening
Speaking 
Reading 
Writing
Reasons to do pair programing:
Greater efficiency
Engaged collaboration/ harder to procaistnate
Learning from other students
Works on social skills
Helps prepare for interview readiness
Helps become familiar with work environment
